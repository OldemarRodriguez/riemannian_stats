### 📊 **Riemannian STATS: Statistical Analysis on Riemannian Manifolds**

**RiemannianStats** is an open-source package that implements a novel principal component analysis methodology adapted for data on Riemannian manifolds, using UMAP as a core tool to construct the underlying geometric structure. This tool enables advanced statistical techniques to be applied to any type of dataset, honoring its local geometry, without requiring the data to originate from traditionally geometric domains like medical imaging or shape analysis.

Instead of assuming data resides in Euclidean space, RiemannianStats transforms any data table into a Riemannian manifold by leveraging the local connectivity extracted from a UMAP-generated k-nearest neighbor graph. On top of this structure, the package computes Riemannian principal components, covariance and correlation matrices, and even provides 2D and 3D visualizations that faithfully capture the dataset’s topology.

With **Riemannian STATS**, you can:

* Incorporate the local geometry of your data for meaningful dimensionality reduction.
* Generate visual representations that better reflect the true structure of your data.
* Use a unified framework that generalizes classical statistical analysis to complex geometric contexts.
* Apply these techniques to both synthetic and real high-dimensional datasets.

This package is ideal for researchers, data scientists, and developers seeking to move beyond the traditional assumptions of classical statistics, applying models that respect the intrinsic structure of data.

## 🔄 Importing Modules and Classes

RiemannianStats supports multiple import styles to improve flexibility and usability:

### ✅ Standard Imports

Use PascalCase class names for clarity and convention:

```python
from riemannian_stats import RiemannianAnalysis, DataProcessing, Visualization, Utilities
````

### ✨ Lowercase Aliases

Alternatively, you can use lowercase aliases for convenience:

```python
from riemannian_stats import riemannian_analysis, DataProcessing, visualization, utilities
```

Both styles provide access to the same classes—choose the one that fits your workflow best.

## 📚 Examples of use
The `examples/` directory contains two comprehensive examples demonstrating how to leverage **Riemannian STATS** for Riemannian data analysis and visualization.

--- 
### Example 1: Iris Dataset

Using the classic Iris dataset (`iris.csv`), this example illustrates the package's capabilities on a well-known, lower-dimensional dataset:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**  
  The Iris dataset is imported using `DataProcessing.load_data()`, with a semicolon as the separator and a dot as the decimal. It checks for a `tipo` column to extract clustering information, which is then separated from the analysis data.

- **Riemannian Analysis:**  
  An instance of `RiemannianAnalysis` is initialized with the dataset and a neighbor count determined as the data length divided by 3. The analysis process includes:
  - Calculation of UMAP graph similarities.
  - Derivation of the rho matrix.
  - Computation of Riemannian vector differences.
  - Generation of the UMAP distance matrix.
  - Calculation of Riemannian covariance and correlation matrices.
  - Extraction of principal components.
  - Determination of explained inertia (as a percentage) using the first two components.
  - Evaluation of correlations between the original variables and principal components.

- **Visualization:**  
  When clustering data is available, the example generates:
  - A **2D scatter plot** with clusters (using dimensions such as `s.largo` and `s.ancho`).
  - A **Principal plane plot** with clusters.
  - A **3D scatter plot** with clusters (adding a third dimension with `p.largo`).
  - A **Correlation circle plot** that is produced in all cases.

### Example 2: Data10D_250 Dataset

This example demonstrates the analysis of a high-dimensional dataset (`Data10D_250.csv`). The workflow includes:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**  
  The dataset is loaded with `DataProcessing.load_data()`, using a comma as the separator and a dot for decimals. If a `cluster` column exists, clustering information is separated from the main analysis data, while retaining a copy for visualization.

- **Riemannian Analysis:**  
  An instance of `RiemannianAnalysis` is created with a neighbor count calculated as the dataset length divided by 5. The analysis includes:
  - UMAP graph similarities.
  - Computation of the rho matrix.
  - Calculation of Riemannian vector differences.
  - Generation of the UMAP distance matrix.
  - Derivation of Riemannian covariance and correlation matrices.
  - Extraction of principal components from the correlation matrix.
  - Calculation of explained inertia using the first two principal components.

- **Visualization:**  
  Depending on the presence of clustering data, the example produces:
  - A **2D scatter plot** with clusters.
  - A **Principal plane plot** showcasing principal components.
  - A **3D scatter plot** with clusters.
  - A **Correlation circle plot** to display correlations between original variables and principal components.

*For full details, see [example2.py](./examples/example2.py)*
